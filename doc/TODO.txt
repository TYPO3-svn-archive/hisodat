Next steps:
- don't forget to do the quickSearch on the imhfields as well

------------------

* localities: with which fieldtype to save latitude longitude?

* dates: with which field type to save dates => strings at the moment

* is it possible to substitute the foreign_wheres completely by PAGE_TSCONFIG_STRING ?

* adapt csh files to the new structure

* ATTENTION: Because there is no destination PID for IRRE records, we don't see existing relations between different tables across sysfolders from the "other" sides

* do a check on required fields
